To access your Fyipe app from steps below:

STEP 1: Make sure external IP's are assigned. 
============================================ 

Please run these commands to get Fyipe URL

$ kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx-ingress-controller --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }}

NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available. 
If the load balancer did not assign an external IP yet (if the IP is still pending). 
Retry this command after few mins. 

============================================ 
STEP 2: Sign Up
============================================

Go to the External IP (generated from step 1) from your browser and sign up a new admin account. 
This is your master admin account (and not a user account).

Log out of the admin account, and log in with a user account to access User's Fyipe Dashboard.
