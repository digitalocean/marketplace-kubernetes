# Paralus

Paralus is a free, open source project that enables **controlled, audited access to Kubernetes infrastructure** for your users, user groups, and services that ships as a GUI, API, and CLI.

It offers access management for developers, architects, and CI/CD tools to remote K8s clusters by consolidating zero-trust access principles such as transaction-level authentication and authorization into a single open-source tool. It helps engineering and architecture teams streamline access control for their fleet of Kubernetes clusters spanning different operating environments, different public clouds and Kubernetes distributions, and on-premises data centers operating behind firewalls.

Paralus can be easily integrated with your pre-existing **SSO providers**, or **Identity Providers (IdP)** that support **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**.

## Features

- Creation of custom roles, users, and groups.
- Custom user role creation and revoking of permissions.
- Ability to control access via pre-configured roles across clusters, namespaces, projects, and more.
- Seamless integration with Identity Providers (IdPs) allowing the use of external authentication engines for users and group definitions, such as GitHub, Google, Azure AD, Okta, and others.
- Automatic logging of all user actions performed for audit and compliance purposes.
- Interact with Paralus either with a modern web GUI (default), a CLI tool called pctl, or Paralus API.
