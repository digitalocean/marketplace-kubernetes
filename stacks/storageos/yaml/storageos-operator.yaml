                re-scheduled if the Pod has been marked as killed.  In practice this
                means that failover of a StatefulSet pod is a manual operation.  By
                enabling Pod Fencing and setting the `storageos.com/fenced=true` label
                on a Pod, StorageOS will enable automated Pod failover (by killing
                the application Pod on the failed node) if the following conditions
                exist:  - Pod fencing has not been explicitly disabled. - StorageOS
                has determined that the node the Pod is running on is   offline.  StorageOS
                uses Gossip and TCP checks and will retry for 30   seconds.  At this
                point all volumes on the failed node are marked   offline (irrespective
                of whether fencing is enabled) and volume   failover starts. - The
                Pod has the label `storageos.com/fenced=true` set. - The Pod has at
                least one StorageOS volume attached. - Each StorageOS volume has at
                least 1 healthy replica.  When Pod Fencing is disabled, StorageOS
                will not perform any interaction with Kubernetes when it detects that
                a node has gone offline. Additionally, the Kubernetes permissions
