# Description

[OpenFaaS](https://docs.openfaas.com/) is an award-winning open source project that makes it easy for developers to deploy applications to Kubernetes in a Serverless-style. Any microservice, API, binary, or function can be packaged and deployed in a very short period of time. Once [a workload](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/workloads/) is deployed via the OpenFaaS [CLI](https://docs.openfaas.com/cli/install/), API or UI metrics will be tracked and used to auto-scale your code in response to demand.

OpenFaaS comes with built-in auto-scaling, [detailed metrics](https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/metrics/) and [queue-processing](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/async/). You can take advantage of pre-made functions from the Function, or a series of templates for Functions or Microservices covering a wide range of languages such as C#, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP, and more.

Your workloads can be accessed through the OpenFaaS gateway or triggered by a number of [event sources](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/triggers/) such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis and Cron.

The project is built around open interfaces that can be extended easily. Tutorials and guides can help you [enable TLS](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/), [setup custom domains](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/#20-ssl-and-custom-domains-for-functions), CI/CD, OAuth2, multi-user support, and many other features.

You can find out more about OpenFaaS at <https://www.openfaas.com/> or take the [free workshop online](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop/).

Note: This stack requires a minimum configuration of 2 Nodes at the $10/month plan (2GB memory / 1 vCPU).

## Getting Started

### How to Connect to Your Cluster

As you get started with Kubernetes on DigitalOcean be sure to check out how to connect to your cluster using `kubectl` and `doctl`:
<https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes/how-to/connect-to-cluster/>

Additional instructions for configuring the [DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/kubernetes/clusters/):

- [How to Set Up a DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes Cluster (DOKS)](https://github.com/digitalocean/Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers/tree/main/01-setup-DOKS#how-to-set-up-a-digitalocean-managed-kubernetes-cluster-doks)
- [How to Set up DigitalOcean Container Registry](https://github.com/digitalocean/Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers/tree/main/02-setup-DOCR#how-to-set-up-digitalocean-container-registry)

### How to confirm that OpenFaaS is running

First, check if the Helm installation was successful, by running below command:

```console
helm ls -n openfaas
```

The output looks similar to (notice that the `STATUS` column value is `deployed`):

```text
NAME          NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED                              STATUS   CHART                APP VERSION
openfaas      openfaas  1        2022-03-02 10:40:25.804165 +0200 EET deployed openfaas-10.0.13
```

Next, verify if the OpenFaaS Pods are up and running:

```console
kubectl get pods -n openfaas -l 'app in (gateway, nats, queue-worker)'
```

The output looks similar to (all Pods should be in a `READY` state, and `STATUS` should be `Running`):

```text
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gateway-7d56f99c9c-xz2hh        2/2     Running   0          87m
nats-697d4bd9fd-4pr5g           1/1     Running   0          87m
queue-worker-7579944c7d-vtf48   1/1     Running   0          87m
```

Finally, OpenFaaS should now be successfully installed and running.

### Tweaking Helm Values

The OpenFaaS provides some custom values to start with. You can always inspect all the available options, as well as the default values for the OpenFaaS Helm chart by running below command:

```console
helm show values openfaas/openfaas --version 10.0.13
```

After tweaking the Helm values file (`values.yml`) according to your needs, you can always apply the changes via `helm upgrade` command, as shown below:

```console
helm upgrade openfaas openfaas/openfaas --version 10.0.13 \
  --namespace openfaas \
  --values values.yml
```

### Configuring TLS with nginx-ingress and cert-manager

The following steps will guide you how to expose your local OpenFaaS functions to the Internet for development & testing.

Before continuing it you need to make sure that the following resources NGINX Ingress Controller and Cert-Manager are installed, you can install them from the [Digital Ocean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/category/kubernetes) as 1-Click App.

Inspect the external IP address of your Nginx Ingress Controller Load Balancer by running below command:

```console
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
```

The output looks similar to (look for the `EXTERNAL-IP` column, containing a valid IP address):

```text
NAME                                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller             LoadBalancer   10.245.110.213   157.230.202.3   80:32375/TCP,443:30249/TCP   88m
ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP      10.245.133.50    <none>          443/TCP                      88m
```

Now create a DNS A record in your DNS manager pointing to your IngressController's public IP (more details <https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager/#create-a-dns-record>).

Before creating the ssl certificate an issuer needs to be created. For convenience we will create an Issuer using Let's Encrypt production API. Replace `<your-email-here>` with the contact email that will be shown with the TLS certificate.

```yaml
# letsencrypt-issuer.yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
  namespace: openfaas
spec:
  acme:
    # You must replace this email address with your own.
    # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
    # certificates, and issues related to your account.
    email:  <your-email-here>
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
      name: prod-issuer-account-key
    # Add a single challenge solver, HTTP01 using nginx
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

```console
kubectl apply -f letsencrypt-issuer.yaml
```

Add TLS to OpenFaaS by creating a custom helm value file. Replace `<your-domain-here>` with the domain that will be used.

```yaml
# tls.yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
    cert-manager.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - <your-domain-here>
      secretName: openfaas-crt
  hosts:
    - host: <your-domain-here>
      serviceName: gateway
      servicePort: 8080
      path: /
```

```console
helm upgrade openfaas \
    --namespace openfaas \
    --reuse-values \
    --values tls.yaml \
    openfaas/openfaas
```

A certificate will be created automatically through cert-manager. You can validate that certificate has been obtained successfully using:

```console
kubectl get certificate \
  -n openfaas \
  openfaas-crt
```

The output looks similar to (notice the READY column status which should be True):

```bash
NAME           READY   SECRET         AGE
openfaas-crt   True    openfaas-crt   152m
```

Finally, you can access the OpenFaaS UI and you can start creating functions.

**Note:**
Retrieve the OpenFaaS credentials running

```console
kubectl -n openfaas get secret basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode

```

### Log into OpenFaaS using faas-cli

You can install the CLI with a curl utility script, brew or by downloading the binary from the releases page. Once installed you'll get the faas-cli command and faas alias. More details can be found here <https://docs.openfaas.com/cli/install/>

First, extract the password:

```console
kubectl get secret -n openfaas basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode > password.txt
```

Next, authenticate to the `faas-cli`

```console
export OPENFAAS_URL=https://<your-domain-here>

cat password.txt | faas-cli login --username admin --password-stdin --gateway https://<your-domain-here>
```

**Note:**

Replace `<your-domain-here>` with the domain that will be used.

Finaly, check that everything worked by deploying a function:

```console
faas-cli store list

# Find one you like

faas-cli store deploy nodeinfo

# List your functions

faas-cli list --verbose

# Check when the function is ready

faas-cli describe nodeinfo

Name:                nodeinfo
Status:              Ready

# Invoke the function using the URL given above, or via `faas-cli invoke`

echo | faas-cli invoke nodeinfo
echo -n "verbose" | faas-cli invoke nodeinfo
```

### Create your first Python function with OpenFaaS

First, create a working folder for your first function:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/functions && cd ~/functions
```

Then, let's scaffold a new Python function using the CLI:

```bash
faas-cli new --lang python3 hello-python
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```text
2022/03/03 15:18:07 No templates found in current directory.
2022/03/03 15:18:07 Attempting to expand templates from https://github.com/openfaas/templates.git
2022/03/03 15:18:09 Fetched 16 template(s) : [csharp dockerfile go java11 java11-vert-x node node12 node12-debian node14 node16 node17 php7 python python3 python3-debian ruby] from https://github.com/openfaas/templates.git
Folder: hello-python created.
```

All your functions should be specified in a YAML file like this - it tells the CLI what to build and deploy onto your OpenFaaS cluster.

Checkout the YAML file `hello-python.yml`:

- gateway- here we can specify a remote gateway if we need to, what the programming language is and where our handler is located within the filesystem.

- functions - this block defines the functions in our stack

- lang: python - even though Docker is used behind the scenes to package your function. You don't have to write your own Dockerfile unless you want to.

- handler - this is the folder / path to your handler.py file and any other source code you need

- image - this is the Docker image name. If you are going to push to the Docker Hub change the prefix from hello-python to include your Docker Hub account - i.e. alexellis/hello-python

Next, let's build the function and push the function image to a registry or the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

**Note:**
In the `hello-python.yml` the image name needs to include your Hub account (eg `image: alexellis2/hello-python`).

Upload the function to a remote registry:

```bash
faas-cli build -f ./hello-python.yml
```

Next, let's deploy the function:

```bash
faas-cli deploy -f ./hello-python.yml
```

The output looks similar to:

```bash
Deploying: hello-python.

Deployed. 202 Accepted.
URL: https://<your-domain>/function/hello-python
```

Finally, test the function using `faas-cli`:

```bash
echo "Hello" | faas-cli invoke hello-python
```

The response from the function will be `Hello`.

### Upgrading the OpenFaaS Chart

You can check what versions are available to upgrade, by navigating to the [OpenFaaS](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/openfaas/openfaas/) official helm charts from Artifacthub.

Then, to upgrade the stack to a newer version, please run the following command (make sure to replace the `<>` placeholders first):

```console
helm upgrade openfaas openfaas/openfaas \
  --version <OPENFAAS_STACK_NEW_VERSION> \
  --namespace openfaas \
  --values <YOUR_HELM_VALUES_FILE>
```

See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation.

### Uninstalling

To uninstall OpenFaaS, you'll need to have Helm 3 installed. Once install, run the following:

```console
helm uninstall openfaas --namespace openfaas
```

followed by:

```console
kubectl delete namespace openfaas openfaas-fn
```
